# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- [x] Review `src/app.js`, `src/server.js`, and project structure based on `plan.md` for initial errors.

## Context
- User requested an initial error review of the Tarot Backend project.
- Reviewed `app.js`, `server.js`, `plan.md`, and `src/` structure.
- No critical errors found in the reviewed files, but identified areas for potential improvement and further review (logging, validation, rate-limiter scope).

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update `techStack.md` based on reviewed files.
- [ ] Update `codebaseSummary.md` with initial findings.
- [ ] Await user feedback or request for deeper review of specific components/files.
